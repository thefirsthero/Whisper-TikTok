Eventually they arrived, they looked kinda fake but kinda real so I just accepted it as I doubt anyone would even realize. Anyways as I'm wearing them I feel somethings off, get home and look at them and notice that the left shoe is a size 6 and the right is a size 7. I tried contacting them about it but they blocked me. Guess I did get scammed. East London"
