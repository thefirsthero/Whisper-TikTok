    "text": "I’m still in love with my ex of three years, even though we’ve both moved on and started dating other people. I’ve been in a relationship for eleven months, and he’s been with someone new for about a month — but no matter how hard I try, I can’t shake what I still feel for him. The truth is, I want to leave my boyfriend, but I don’t want to hurt him. He’s a good person, and he doesn’t deserve to be caught in the middle of my confusion. It’s tearing me apart inside because I know staying isn’t fair either. Right now, I feel like my head is going to explode. The worst part is he’s on his way to my house, and I have no idea how to act or what to say. I feel completely stuck between doing what’s right and doing what my heart is screaming for. Klerksdorp"
